## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

At this point I've done a few of the newbie challenges and things are starting to get a little repetitive. I'm sure that the code that I write can be optimized in some way that would require much less code but at this stage I feel I need to move on to something a bit more challenging. But I wont. 

Repetition is the best teacher and before I move on to the next level of challenges I want to learn CSS Grid. I keep stating that I'll CSS Grid in these README docs but I haven't yet. The main reason, I tend to start new challenges during the week when I have to worry about my day job as an accountant. By the time I get home my brain power is about exhausted so learning something seems very challenging that I take the path of least resistance.

Going forward, I'm going to start new challenges on the weekends so I'm more inclined to learn rather than just accomplish. 

### Continued development

My next challenge will be using CSS Grid. No, ands, ifs or buts. I believe strongly that it will help out immensely in properly laying out my websites.

Working with images seems to be a challenge for me. I'm going to spend a bit more time on it on the next challenge. 

### Useful resources

At this stage, I depended a lot on the notes that I've been taking on Notion. Writting things down has saved me so much time googling finding answers to problems I've already found.
